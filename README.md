This repository is a copy of my final project in my Computer Systems II course at James Madison University. The project specifications can be found here[[https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/kirkpams/361/projects/p3-dhcp.shtml]]


# Background:
As we began the second half of our semester in Computer Systems II, we shifted our focus to networked concurrency and connectivity. So, this included topics such as IP addressing, the internet model, transport-layer protocols, application layer broadcasting, and wireless connectivity. Accordingly, our second project in this course was to implement a simulation of the client side of a DHCP protocol, establishing network settings for a client. To accomplish this, we used BOOTP packet interpretation and UDP requests/responses. The project shown below build upon the client side DHCP implementation.
